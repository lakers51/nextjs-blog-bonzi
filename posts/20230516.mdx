When sadness seems to grasp your heart,
And you can't seem to find a start,
Remember all the good that's come,
And know that you can overcome.

Each day brings forth a brand new chance,
To rise above and dance the dance,
To chase the darkness far away,
And let the sunshine guide your way.

There's beauty in the world we see,
In every flower, every tree,
In every laugh and every smile,
In every moment, all the while.

So let your heart be filled with light,
And know that all will be alright,
For every storm must pass away,
And hope will come to light your way.

So hold your head up high and strong,
And know that you can sing your song,
For in your heart there lies a spark,
That shines and guides you through the dark.
