Reduced errors and disputes: E-contracts are digital, which means they can be easily checked for errors and discrepancies. This can help reduce disputes and legal issues.

Increased security: E-contracts use electronic signatures and encryption techniques, making them more secure than paper contracts.

Green Initiative: E-contracts are environmentally friendly as they reduce the use of paper and contribute to sustainability.

Cost Saving: E-contracts are a cost-effective solution compared to traditional paper contracts, as they reduce printing, mailing, storage, and administrative costs.
